    testimonial: 'The services are exemplary. The first session begins with an assessment of your goals, teaching options an overview of their program. Thereafter, the student is provided with one on one instruction that is fun, interactive and engaging. Within a short period of time, the student will be able to design blogs, calendars, website, and other projects. Homework and other learning material are free. There are no hidden fees. I highly recommend the services.',
